## **What to bring... check your checklist!**

1.  A windbreaker or light jacket  
Although there is an average temperature of over 40 degrees celcius, this will be needed to survive the cooler nights

2. A headscarf or desert hats  
To block the sun and dust.

3. Hiking Boots  
For the day and night treks.

4. Comfortable jeans or trousers  
To cover your whole leg to protect from the camel's rough fur.

5. Water bottle  
We've got the water, fill up at each camel stop!

## **Reviews**

'As sunset approached, our group climbed to the top of a sand dune which was situated behind our camp. Everything was perfect. There was virtually no sound, and I began to take the absurdity of just how far out I was, the light was perfect. We settled down for a lovely meal in the evening by the fire. Although it got quite cold by the night, there was ample bedding available, and the warmth from the fire was more than adequate to keep comftorble.' - Liakat's review of her sahara holiday
