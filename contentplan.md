To block the sun and dust.

3. Hiking Boots  
For the day and night treks.

4. Comfortable jeans or trousers  
To cover your whole leg to protect from the camel's rough fur.

The summer is one to avoid - Between June and September the sun is simply too hot for it to be enjoyable.  
Winter is manageable if you werap up warm; however, the  best time to visit the Sahara Desert is definitely in spring or autumn.  
By October the searing heat of the summer has passed awaybut it's still pleasant after dark. Similar temperaturesare found in spring, but between February and April, sandstorms are common.

'As sunset approached, our group climbed to the top of a sand dune which was situated behind our camp. Everything was perfect. There was virtually no sound, and I began to take the absurdity of just how far out I was, the light was perfect. We settled down for a lovely meal in the evening by the fire. Although it got quite cold by the night, there was ample bedding available, and the warmth from the fire was more than adequate to keep comftorble.' - Liakat after her Sahara holiday
